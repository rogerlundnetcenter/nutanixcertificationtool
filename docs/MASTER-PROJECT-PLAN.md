## YEAR 4+ (200+ weeks): The Long Game

- **CertStudy OS:** A dedicated thin Linux distro that boots straight into the study app
- **Hardware partnerships:** Pre-loaded study tablets sold at Nutanix conferences
- **Academic program:** Free access for universities, curriculum integration
- **Annual conference:** CertStudyCon — physical study bootcamps
- **AI certification:** Our own micro-certifications recognized by industry
- **Acquisition target?** Become so integral Nutanix buys it (or we don't care, it's sustainable)

---

## Sprint Velocity Assumptions

- **1 developer (you):** 1-2 story points per sprint
- **1 developer + AI pair:** 3-5 story points per sprint
- **Small team (3 devs):** 8-12 story points per sprint

Current mode: **1 developer + AI pair** = high velocity, parallel workstreams.
